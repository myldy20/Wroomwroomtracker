# Build notes

Run all commands from the repository root unless stated otherwise.

## Windows

Use MSYS2 UCRT64:

```sh
cd tracker
make -j4 windows
```

The executable and bundled files are written to `tracker/build/windows/`.
The Windows makefile enables `_USE_MATH_DEFINES` before compiling, so the
vendored SID core can use the CRT math constants under C++17. The Docker
cross-build enables the same flag.

The ChooChooPlayer visualizer uses the same Windows toolchain:

```sh
cd tracker
make -j4 choochooplayer
```

Its self-contained package is written to `choochooplayer/build/windows/`.
Run `launch-alf-dance.bat` there to preview the bundled `alf dance.cct` project.

## Linux / Steam Deck (x86_64)

For a native local test, use the existing Ubuntu-24.04 WSL distribution with
`g++`, `make`, `libsdl2-dev`, and `libasound2-dev` (for MIDI I/O, see below)
installed. From `tracker` in that distribution:

```sh
make -j4 -f Makefile.linux linux-package \
  COMMON_CFLAGS='-std=c++17 -Wall -g -Os -DTEST' VERSION=1.0.9-deck-test
ldd build/linux/choochootracker
tar -tzf build/linux/ChooChooTracker-$(date +%Y-%m-%d)-1.0.9-deck-test-Linux-x86_64.tar.gz
```

The archive includes the executable, runtime assets, manual, and licenses.
SDL2 and its system dependencies must be available on the target. A build
against Ubuntu 24.04 is a local compatibility test, not a Steam Linux Runtime
compatibility guarantee; check dependencies and playback on the target Deck.

Use SteamOS Devkit Client to pair the Deck and upload the extracted package.
Set the launch command to `./chipnomad.sh` and disable Steam Play for this
native build. The existing complete Windows package can also be tested with
Steam Play enabled and `./choochootracker.exe` as its launch command. Local
devkit testing does not require uploading a Steam store build.

For the Deck test, set `audioBufferSize: 512` in the extracted application's
`settings.txt` while it is closed, then relaunch. On the tested Deck with
SteamOS 3.8.16 and Proton 11.0, PSY played cleanly and its scope, waveforms,
and Table cursor became fluid at 512 frames. With the default 4906 frames
at 48 kHz, those displays advanced in visible jumps despite a 60 FPS overlay:
the engine processes about 102 ms of audio per callback. At 512 frames this
falls to about 10.7 ms. This observation validates that test configuration;
it does not establish a safe buffer size for every supported device.

### MIDI I/O

Desktop builds (Linux/Windows/macOS) link RtMidi (vendored at
`chipnomad_lib/external/rtmidi`) for realtime MIDI in/out - see
`docs/USER_MANUAL.md`'s MIDI section for what it's used for. Backend
selection is per platform Makefile: `-D__LINUX_ALSA__ -D__LINUX_ALSASEQ__`
plus `-lasound` on Linux, `-D__WINDOWS_MM__` plus `-lwinmm` on Windows,
`-D__MACOSX_CORE__` plus the CoreMIDI/CoreAudio/CoreFoundation frameworks on
macOS. `Dockerfile.linux` installs `libasound2-dev` for the Docker-based
Linux build.

### AppImage

```sh
make -j4 -f Makefile.linux appimage
```

Produces `releases/ChooChooTracker-<date>-<version>-x86_64.AppImage`. Bundles
only `libSDL2` and its `libsamplerate` dependency into `usr/lib` - the two
libraries the tar.gz release's README tells users to `apt install` - and
lets everything else (X11, ALSA, glibc...) resolve from the host, to avoid
the ABI-mismatch risk of bundling core OS libraries into an AppImage.

Requires `appimagetool` on `PATH` - it is not downloaded automatically, since
the only available URL for it is a `continuous` release tag that isn't
pinned to a fixed version, which would make the build not reproducible.
Install it first, e.g.:

```sh
curl -L -o /usr/local/bin/appimagetool https://github.com/AppImage/AppImageKit/releases/download/continuous/appimagetool-x86_64.AppImage
chmod +x /usr/local/bin/appimagetool
```

The GitHub Actions workflow `.github/workflows/appimage.yml` builds the
AppImage inside a `debian:10` container (glibc 2.28, packages from
`archive.debian.org`) so it runs on Debian 10+ and Ubuntu 20.04+ including
22.04. Trigger it by hand (`workflow_dispatch`), by pushing `linux-appimage`
or a `v*` tag; the AppImage is uploaded as the `choochootracker-appimage`
artifact.

`fileGetDefaultDirectory()` (`src/corelib/corelib_file.cpp`) detects the
`APPIMAGE` environment variable the AppImage runtime sets and resolves
settings/autosave to `$XDG_DATA_HOME/ChooChooTracker`, falling back to
`~/.local/share/ChooChooTracker` when `$XDG_DATA_HOME` is unset, instead of
next to the executable, since an AppImage mounts itself read-only -
confirmed by running the produced AppImage under Xvfb with an isolated
`$HOME` and checking that `settings.txt`/`autosave.cct` land there rather
than inside the `/tmp/.mount_*` squashfs mount.

`packaging/common/*` (bonus themes, instruments, sample projects, title art)
is bundled read-only under `usr/share/choochootracker/common`. Since the
AppImage itself can't be written to, `AppRun` seeds a writable copy into the
same `$XDG_DATA_HOME`-aware directory every time it runs, copying each
top-level bonus directory independently and only if it's missing on the
destination - so an interrupted first run, or a user who already created
their own e.g. `projects` folder before the rest was seeded, still gets the
remaining bonus content on a later launch instead of never seeing it.
`AppRun` then starts the executable from that workspace, so relative assets
including the animated title artwork resolve from the writable copy rather
than the read-only mount (or the caller's current directory).
`initDefaultAppSettings()` (`src/common.cpp`) points
`projectPath`/`samplePath`/`themePath`/etc at that same directory when
`fileIsRunningFromAppImage()` is true - normal desktop builds keep their
existing behavior (relative paths, resolved via the launcher script's `cd`)
untouched. Confirmed under Xvfb with a fresh `$HOME`: first launch populates
every subfolder, the files are writable, and the Project screen's Load
browser lists the bundled example songs from the seeded (not the read-only)
copy.

## Web

Emscripten is installed locally at `.tmp/emsdk`; do not search for or install
another copy. In PowerShell:

```powershell
Set-ExecutionPolicy -Scope Process -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -Force
. .\.tmp\emsdk\emsdk_env.ps1
$env:PATH += ';C:\msys64\usr\bin;C:\msys64\ucrt64\bin'
$empy = $env:EMSDK_PYTHON -replace '\\','/'
$empp = "$env:EMSDK/upstream/emscripten/em++.py"
Set-Location tracker
& 'C:\msys64\usr\bin\make.exe' -j8 -f Makefile.web web-deploy `
  'COMMON_CFLAGS=-std=c++17 -Wall -g -Os -DTEST' `
  "EMXX=$empy $empp"
```

The deploy target updates the checked-in browser bundle in `web/dist/`; Vercel
serves it directly. Commit that directory after every WebAssembly source
change. The bundled SDK requires its own Python, hence the explicit `EMXX`.
If Windows reports `clang++.exe: permission denied`, unblock the bundled
compiler with `Unblock-File -LiteralPath .tmp\emsdk\upstream\bin\clang++.exe`,
verify `clang++.exe --version`, then retry.

## PortMaster (ARM64)

Use the existing Ubuntu WSL2 toolchain:

```sh
cd tracker
make -j4 -f Makefile.portmaster PortMaster-deploy \
  COMMON_CFLAGS='-std=c++17 -Wall -g -Os -DTEST'
```

The package is copied to `releases/choochootracker.zip`. The local build copy
is `tracker/build/portmaster/choochootracker.zip`. The explicit flags avoid a
current GCC 9 LTO internal compiler error. Validate the release archive before
uploading it:

```powershell
& 'C:\Program Files\7-Zip\7z.exe' t releases\choochootracker.zip
```

## Android / Google Play

The Android app is `com.paiheulevrai.choochootracker`, targets API 36, and
uses no storage permissions. It builds both 64-bit and 32-bit ARM libraries.
Install the Android SDK/NDK selected by `ANDROID_HOME` (or set
`ANDROID_NDK_ROOT`). Build each native ABI with MSYS2 UCRT64. This only needs
to happen after native C/C++ changes:

```powershell
$env:ANDROID_NDK_ROOT = "$env:LOCALAPPDATA\Android\Sdk\ndk\30.0.16248370"
& 'C:\msys64\usr\bin\bash.exe' -c `
  'export PATH=/ucrt64/bin:/usr/bin:$PATH; cd /c/Users/<you>/Desktop/choochootracker/tracker; make -f Makefile.android android ARCH=arm64-v8a'
& 'C:\msys64\usr\bin\bash.exe' -c `
  'export PATH=/ucrt64/bin:/usr/bin:$PATH; cd /c/Users/<you>/Desktop/choochootracker/tracker; make -f Makefile.android android ARCH=armeabi-v7a'
```

The native build also needs SDL 2.32.10 headers in
`.tmp/SDL2-2.32.10/SDL2`; retrieve the matching SDL source archive once and
copy its `include/*.h` files into that directory if it is absent.
If an NDK wrapper reports `clang++.exe: Permission denied`, unblock the shared
NDK compiler (not the wrapper) before retrying:

```powershell
Unblock-File -LiteralPath "$env:ANDROID_NDK_ROOT\toolchains\llvm\prebuilt\windows-x86_64\bin\clang++.exe"
```

The first Gradle package build can download its wrapper distribution, so it
needs network access.

For a signed release, create one upload key once. Keep its `.jks` file in a
safe backup and its password in a password manager: losing either prevents
future updates with the same upload identity. Do not commit the key or its
password. `tracker/platforms/android/*.jks` and `keystore.properties` are
ignored by Git.

The build accepts either an ignored `keystore.properties` file or environment
variables. On Windows PowerShell, the latter avoids putting a secret in a
project file:

```powershell
$env:JAVA_HOME = 'C:\Program Files\Android\Android Studio\jbr'
$env:CCT_KEYSTORE_FILE = 'choochootracker-upload.jks' # relative to platforms/android
$env:CCT_KEY_ALIAS = 'choochootracker-upload'
$env:CCT_KEYSTORE_PASSWORD = '<upload-key-password>'
$env:CCT_KEY_PASSWORD = $env:CCT_KEYSTORE_PASSWORD
Push-Location tracker\platforms\android
& "$env:JAVA_HOME\bin\java.exe" -classpath gradle\wrapper\gradle-wrapper.jar `
  org.gradle.wrapper.GradleWrapperMain --no-daemon --console=plain `
  assembleRelease bundleRelease -x buildNativeArm64 -x buildNativeArm32
Pop-Location
```

The `-x` options avoid concurrent/redundant native builds: Gradle only packages
the two libraries produced above. Every bundle uploaded to Play Console needs a
strictly greater `versionCode`; update `versionCode` in
`tracker/platforms/android/app/build.gradle` before each upload. The displayed
`versionName` may stay unchanged for a replacement internal build.

The signed Play artifact is
`tracker/platforms/android/app/build/outputs/bundle/release/app-release.aab`.
It contains `arm64-v8a` and `armeabi-v7a` native libraries plus all bundled
content from `tracker/packaging/common`: projects, samples, instruments,
themes, fonts, AY/SR wavetables, waveforms and title assets. Confirm it before
uploading:

```powershell
& 'C:\Program Files\Android\Android Studio\jbr\bin\jar.exe' tf `
  tracker\platforms\android\app\build\outputs\bundle\release\app-release.aab
```

The same Gradle command produces the signed direct-install APK; install it with
`adb install -r <apk>`. For handoff, copy and name the files outside Gradle's
output directory, for example `releases/ChooChooTracker-1.0-code2-release.aab`.
Upload that AAB to Play Console's Internal testing track. Complete the values
and artwork in `docs/play-store-listing.md` before submission.

For audio traces and the separately installed debug APK, see

## Validation

```sh
cd tracker
make -f Makefile.test -j4
```

On Windows (`OS=Windows_NT`), the test makefile enables `_USE_MATH_DEFINES`,
matching the application build's CRT math constants for the vendored SID core.

If MSYS2 reports exit code 127 after `Built: build/tests/run_tests.exe`, run
`build/tests/run_tests.exe` directly; the executable is the authoritative test
result in that environment.

## Native chip instruments

The normal builds include the native instruments and shipped preset catalog.
Synth core sources live under `chipnomad_lib/external/`; each new dependency
includes its license and provenance. Preset source licenses are packaged under
`tracker/packaging/common/licenses/`. See `docs/native-chip-instruments.md`.

PortMaster appends `-O3` only for native synth cores and adapters through
`Makefile.native-chip-flags`; other platform and audio settings are unchanged.
The native UI/audio harnesses are developer-only targets in
`Makefile.native-chip-device` and are not included in release packages.

To regenerate factory data, build `chip-factory` with `Makefile.test`, then use
`tools/chip_banks/convert.py` and the documented expansion/SID conversion tools.
The ordinary build uses the checked-in presets and needs no network access.
